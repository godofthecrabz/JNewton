# JNewton
**About JNewton**  
JNewton is a library that provides java bindings to the Newton Dynamics Physics Engine. JNewton was created to test the capabilities of [Project Panama](https://openjdk.org/projects/panama/) and to provide java programmers with a physics library that wasn't updated a decade ago.  
**Important Info**  
JNewton is a library written and maintained (as of writing this) by one person and is based on a physics library with little documentation.  There will without a doubt be bugs in some if not all of the provided classes and the performance may not be the best. Please feel free to report any issues with the library :)  
**Upcoming**  
These are items planned for this repo. They may be completed in any order.
 - Demo using JNewton
 - JavaDocs for JNewton
 - Release version of JNewton 
**License**
There is no license for this library right now. Any user is free to clone/fork this repo and to use/modify the code within it.
